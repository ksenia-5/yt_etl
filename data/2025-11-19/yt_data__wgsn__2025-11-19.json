Intimates and Lingeries is often a category split between the fun - read sexy - and the functional and never the twain shall meet. But the smalls category has come on in leaps and bounds and in this episode we chart the shift towards inclusiveness, review the latest trends and look ahead to the future.\n\n\n\nExploring the finer details of the intimates and lingerie market is our special guest host Francesca Muston, VP of WGSN Fashion with colleagues Lorna Hall, Director of Fashion and Sofia Martellini, Senior Strategist Fashion. \n\n\n\nWe broach topics like leak-proof wear, reflect on seminal cultural underwear moments and how the pandemic redefined comfort for bras and consider the progress yet to be made on inclusivity in the male underwear category. Plus, expect to hear about how internet-breaking Kim Kardashian (Skims) and Rihanna (Savage x Fenty) have been pivotal in recent shifts in this category. So pull on your big girl pants and tune in…",

Director of Editorial at WGSN Bethan Ryder speaks about the age-agnostic shift we are seeing in beauty products. Age-agnostic is essentially a move away from skin resilience claims – serving the need, not the number – and a shift from ‘age appropriate’ makeup. To help flesh out this idea, Bethan speaks to Cassandra Napoli, Senior Strategist on Insight, and Pia Fisher, Beauty Strategist. Cassandra and Pia give insight and examples of the ways brands are pivoting on the language used in relation to beauty products for older consumers. Bethan dispels the claim that youth is the pinnacle of beauty, citing pop culture references of where ageing is celebrated, in the form of Madonna and Pamela Anderson. The team explore the idea of ageing well and embracing your age amid the backdrop of an AI renaissance. Examples of the latter include Hollywood actors being de-aged, and influencers ‘hacking’ their biological age by using social media filters. Cassandra shares tips on the language brands should be adopting, the importance of online communities and the power of visibility – how seeing ourselves in campaigns makes us more inclined to engage with brands.",

If they were to rewrite that hit today, the new title might well be TikTok Killed the Radio Star. \n\n\nOn the one hand TikTok and other social media platforms surface music in very short snippets, so a song that lasts around three minutes stands little chance of a full airing. But on the other hand, TikTok is a fantastic global creator of viral earworms, so you could argue it’s an excellent window where artists can show off their work. \n\n\nThese are some of the things that Carla Buzasi talks to Kelly Betts about in this episode of Lives of Tomorrow, where we discuss the future of music. Kelly is the Editor of BBC Introducing, BBC Radio's platform supporting unsigned, undiscovered, and under-the-radar UK music talent. It launched in 2007 and has helped support the careers of artists including The 1975, Florence and the Machine and Tom Grennan. \n\n\nCarla and Kelly also consider whether AI can write the perfect pop song, why concerts were the first thing to bounce back after the pandemic, and how music engages us in a way that nothing else can. ",

Her experience has informed a series of books, her latest being Nomad Century: How to Survive the Climate Upheaval, which explores how we can plan for and manage climate migration, and how we can restore the planet to a habitable state. The Financial Times called it “a future atlas of human geography, showing where will be habitable and for how many”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCarla and Gaia discuss how climate-related migration could help solve some of its impacts, and the concept of ‘just transition’ – moving to a more sustainable economy in a way that is fair for everyone. Gaia also shares her predictions for the future, and explains why it’s critical to act now and have a vision for our future cities, so that infrastructure is in place for our fast-evolving world.",

        "description": "This episode of the Lives of Tomorrow podcast looks at how we engage with faith, spirituality and religion. What is religion? What does it mean and how do we engage, if at all? How does it impact us and in 5-10 years what will the landscape of religion look like? In this episode we explore the idea that AI has the power to write its own religious book that people can follow.\n\n\nBrielle Saggese is an insight strategist at WGSN and writes forecasts on various topics. In her forecast ‘Remixing Religion’ Brielle explores how young people are engaging with faith, purpose and religious ideas in new ways. She studies how their search for meaning will impact in-person experiences, aesthetics and rituals in the US, UK and EMEA markets.\n\n\nIn this episode, we cover:\n\n  •  Alternative religions\n  •  Data charting the fastest growing religions\n  •  Spirituality of religious public gatherings\n  •  Impact social media is having on young people in relation to religion\n\n\nBrielle shares the insights acquired through her research as well as her lived experience with religion from her childhood to now and how she navigates faith with host Carla Buzasi, CEO of trend forecasting and consumer insight company WGSN.\n\n\nLearn more about her work here (https://www.wgsn.com/en/demo) .",

        "description": "By 2033, it's likely that robots will take over household chores such as cooking, cleaning, and washing. With this automation, family members may even be able to have personalised meals without the kids complaining. \n\n\nAccording to research conducted by Oxford University, AI is predicted to save 40% of the time we currently spend on household work. In this interview with Professor Ekaterina Hertog, lead researcher behind the study, Carla Buzasi explores what this means for the future and how AI will impact jobs. Additionally, they discuss how robots will handle the knowledge they learn about us when they enter our homes.",

It’s anticipated that they will transform everything from pop-culture and online shopping to education and work.

        "description": "This week Bethan Ryder talks with Beauty experts Hannah Mauser, Sienna Piccioni and Brielle Saggese about the huge trend right now for celebrity owned beauty brands. From Pharrell to Gwyneth Paltrow, Kim Kardashian to Kate Moss, and even Stella McCartney, it seems like you're not an A-Lister right now without your very own skincare range. At the time of publishing we hear Brad Pitt has also launched a genderless skincare line.\n\n\n\nBut how does this differ from the celebrity endorsements of the past? What role has social media played in the boom? And which brands do we see chiming with WGSN's trend forecasts for the future? ",

As we all went into that first lockdown we quickly slid into slouch - the move to sweatpants was overnight and many feared the denim category wouldn’t recover, but recover it did - almost as soon as lockdowns lifted, and it’s projected to continue growing with Allied Market Research projecting it to hit $88.1bn by 2030 but the denim industry post-pandemic looks very different to the one we knew and loved.\n\n\n\nIn this episode the team discusses everything from fit cycle data, TikTok and Y2K brand influencers, to sustainability and new fabric innovation.",

        "description": "When WGSN started out 15 years ago, Google was still in its Beta phase and most retailers hadn't begun to consider the prospect of selling their wares online, let alone envisioning the global connectivity sites like Facebook and Twitter would bring.\n \nFast forward to 2013 and the world as we knew it has completely transformed. Classic marketplaces have been disrupted, new initiatives have both emerged and disappeared at the speed of light, and consumers now have more of a voice than ever. Keeping up is a 24/7 challenge; but never more of an exciting one. The question is, what will the next 15 years hold?\n \nWe got together with industry leaders for a Google Hangout to celebrate our anniversary with both a walk down fashion's memory lane in an exploration of the modern history of the internet, and a viewpoint on the innovations set to shape the future.﻿\n\nWGSN's senior digital media editor, Rachel Arthur moderated the debate and was joined by a panel of industry experts including:\n· Uri Minkoff, CEO of Rebecca Minkoff \n· Justin Cooke founder and CEO of Innovate7 and former CMO of Topshop\n· Nicola Peters director of innovation and experience at Innovate7  \n· Amy Levin founder and creative director of College Fashionista   \n· Sandra Halliday, editor-in-chief of WGSN\n· Ruth Marshall-Johnson director of advisory services at WGSN Group ﻿",
