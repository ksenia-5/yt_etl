But there is often too much focus on short-term gains in revenue or #sustainability and waste reduction metrics, while overlooking their full #business value. \n\nIn the third part of our mini series on the Ellen MacArthur Foundation’s new report: How not to fail: Avoiding 10 common pitfalls when scaling circular business models, we hear how, when circular business models are pitched primarily around sustainability, internal commitment is lower.\n\nPippa is joined by the report’s lead researchers, Maddy Oliver and Ella Hedley, to explore why circular business models rarely scale without a strong, broad financial case. \n\nThey also talk about the need for more commercial collaboration.

Major voluntary efforts convened by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation and others have shown what is possible and the effectiveness of collective action. An international treaty based on global rules addressing the full plastics life cycle – how we make, use, manage, and reuse plastics – is the best chance we have to scale those to a global level.\n\nThe final negotiations for a UN Global Plastics Treaty will take place in Busan, Korea this November. Global rules can transform the plastics system to benefit people and prevent plastic waste from being created in the first place. Governments must seize this chance and agree to an ambitious treaty with legally-binding, global rules across the plastics life cycle.\n\nThis interview aired on BBC World News America on the 25th of September 2024, at 5pm ET.\n------\nThank you for watching this video.

A key part of this solution is Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR).\n\n\nMandatory, fee-based EPR policy places responsibility on producers with regard to the collection, sorting and recirculation of the products they place on the market. EPR also creates transparency and traceability on global material flows, and helps to attract capital investments in the infrastructure needed to reuse and recycle at scale.\n\n\nIn today’s episode of the Circular Economy Show, we are joined by Anjali Krishnan, the Programme Manager for IDH Alternate Materials in India, Tomás Saieg, Head of the Circular Economy Office in the Ministry of the Environment for Chile, and Matteo Magnani, co-author of the Ellen MacArthur Foundation's report \"Pushing the boundaries of EPR policy for textiles\". Together, they will look at the global challenges and opportunities in developing a circular economy for textiles.\n\n\nDo you want to know more about EPR for textiles?

Thanks to their startup program, their help craft similar schemes across the UK, all of which have come together to form \"The Better Food Traders Network\". The key focus is linking farmers that focus on regenerative farming with enterprises to sell their food locally. \n\nSitopia Farms is a modern urban farm in London that grows a wide variety of vegetables, including strains that have almost disappeared. Two core principles govern the farm \n- Organic, meaning no pesticides or herbicides \n- No dig, minimal soil disruption\nThese regenerative agricultural techniques ensure they are being sustainable and ecologically minded to benefit our future. \n\n------\nThank you for watching this video.

        "description": "The global food system is responsible for between 20-30% of greenhouse gas emissions, most of which are generated at the production stage. Take rice, for example, a food staple that is eaten regularly by over half the world’s population. \nConventional rice production generates emissions equivalent to the entire global aviation industry. So how can we produce rice in a way that uses fewer resources and regenerates nature? A growing number of farmers around the world are changing the way they produce rice, by adopting an agroecological approach called the System of Rice Intensification (SRI). \nThis method relies on a small group of simple interventions that together significantly reduces water use, methane production, and the use of chemicals, while providing better yields and reducing labour for rice farmers. \nMultinational companies who support this type of agriculture through procurement and product design can address their scope 3 emissions and build resilience in their supplier communities. \nAccording to Project Drawdown, SRI currently accounts for 4% of rice production. If this was increased to 25%, the emissions reduction would be equivalent to that which is currently generated by the whole of India.\n------\nThank you for watching this video.

        "description": "The Ellen MacArthur Foundation's 2017 report ‘A New Textiles Economy: Redesigning fashions future’ found that a truckload of garments goes to landfill or incineration, globally, every single second. The fashion industry follows a take-make-waste formula - we take from the earth, make a product and when we’re done with it, we throw it away. The fashion industry cannot continue in this way - it’s wasteful and polluting. It needs a redesign. \n\nTransforming fashion towards a circular economy requires new ways to create and make clothes and The Jeans Redesign provides the perfect starting point - redesigning this iconic fashion staple using circular design principles. Guidelines set out by the Foundation alongside over 80 denim industry experts ensure that jeans are used more, made to be made again, and made from safe and recycled or renewable inputs. The Jeans Redesign is creating solutions for a world where clothes never become waste by bringing together 100 brands, mills and manufacturers to design and make products fit for a circular economy, today.\n\nFind out more about the Jeans Redesign project at https://www.ellenmacarthurfoundation.org/our-work/activities/make-fashion-circular/projects/the-jeans-redesign\n\n#circulardesign\n------\nThank you for watching this video.

Millions of tonnes of plastic leak into the environment, end up in landfills or are burned because of our take-make-waste linear economy. This is harming nature, using up natural resources, and contributing to the climate and biodiversity crises, while billions of dollars worth of valuable materials are being lost to the economy.\r\nMany companies have taken important voluntary steps, such as setting targets to reduce virgin plastic use and pilot reuse schemes,  laying the foundations for wide-reaching cooperation, but they cannot reach the scale we need to urgently solve this crisis. Plastic pollution doesn’t care about borders. Countries and organisations can’t fix the problem on their own. It is a global challenge that needs a coordinated and globally aligned response.\r\nWe must urgently work towards seeing ambition become action.

More than 2 million people around the world, +700 civil society groups, +70 global companies, and more than ¾ of UN member countries back this call.\n\nThere’s no time to waste. Every day, the plastic pollution crisis gets worse, and it doesn’t care about borders. Countries and organisations can’t fix the problem on their own through voluntary agreements and existing measures. It is a global challenge that needs a coordinated and globally aligned response.\n\nIn February, world leaders have a once in a lifetime opportunity at the United Nations Environmental Assembly (UNEA) to begin negotiations for a treaty on plastic pollution.\n\nWe need our governments to act now to fix plastic pollution for good, before it’s too late.\n\nFind out more at: https://unplasticstreaty.org/ \n\n#AllEyesOnUNEA #PlasticTreaty #NoTimeToWaste #CircularEconomy\n\n------\nThank you for watching this video.

But what if it was possible to reverse that and to create food that was nature and climate positive? The Ellen MacArthur Foundation's newest publication argues that not only is this possible through better design, but also represents a significant opportunity for food manufacturers and retailers to make food that’s better for customers, better for farmers, and better for business.\r\nIn this episode of the Circular Economy Show, we'll be joined by Emma Chow and Gaelle Le Gelard from the Foundation's team to discuss:\r\nWhy we need to move beyond incremental sourcing improvements to a rethink of ingredients and product portfolios, especially amongst the globe’s largest food manufacturers and retailers.\r\nWhy ‘food design' is such a crucial concept for the future of our food system.\r\nWhat the nature positive foods of the future might actually look like.",

Defining economic growth by prosperity, job creation, and resilience rather than GDP, can enable people and the environment to thrive, and greenhouse gas emissions, waste, and pollution to become a thing of the past. To achieve this requires a redesign of our economic system and for both the public and private sectors to take transformative action. This episode covers how this can be done.

By focusing more of their efforts on upstream innovation – at the design stage of a product rather than just via downstream efforts, such as recycling – businesses can prevent waste from ever being created in the first place. \n\nHowever, for large businesses with complex supply chains and processes, it isn’t always easy to keep pace with circular innovation and to embrace new operating models. By contrast, startups that have the disruptive solutions to solve these linear challenges often lack the capital, resources or enabling networks to replicate and scale up their solutions rapidly.\n\nWith a specific lens on upstream innovations for packaging and learning from recent pilot projects, this session will explore how multinationals and emerging innovators can work together to forge a path to a truly circular model, at scale.",

Ironically, this is the group that suffers disproportionately from hunger, poverty and impacts of climate change.  Improving the way small farms are designed and managed so that they’re more productive and profitable is an important mechanism for dealing with these issues in a systemic way. \n\nEmma Naluyima, a farmer in Uganda, has demonstrated that it is possible to produce abundant and diverse food on a one-acre farm while reducing inputs and increasing profits. She does this through the circular management of resources, a focus on healthy soils, and the application of appropriate technology.\n\nRead more about the Ellen MacArthur Foundation Food initiative: https://www.ellenmacarthurfoundation.org/our-work/activities/food\nInside the Circular Economy in Africa: https://www.ellenmacarthurfoundation.org/our-work/activities/learning-opportunities/focus-on-africa\nAbout Emma Naluyima: http://emmanaluyima.com/\n\nFunded by the IKEA Foundation.\n------\nThank you for watching this video.

Food loss has a detrimental impact on farmers’ incomes, land use, and food security. \n\nEnter Agricycle. In this film, we learn how Agricycle’s approach uses technology and market linkages to help more than 35, 000 farmers around the world address the issue of food loss.  Passive solar dehydrators are designed to maximize solar energy for the efficient drying of fruit. By connecting growers in poor areas of the world to international markets, farmers can get a fair price for their produce allowing them to invest in housing, education, health and a chance of a better life.\n\nRead more about the Ellen MacArthur Foundation Food initiative: https://www.ellenmacarthurfoundation.org/our-work/activities/food\nInside the Circular Economy in Africa: https://www.ellenmacarthurfoundation.org/our-work/activities/learning-opportunities/focus-on-africa\nAbout agricycle: https://agricycleglobal.com/\n\nFunded by the IKEA Foundation.\n\n------\nThank you for watching this video.

        "description": "Smallholder farming is the backbone of the African economy, but productivity is well below the global average. African farmers find it difficult to make a decent living or have to expand their growing area into virgin wilderness which impacts biodiversity. One of the main reasons for this is the depletion of key nutrients in the soil that are needed to support healthy plant growth. \n\nRural farmers in emerging African economies often pay much more than the rest of the world for their fertilizers. In this film, we look at how Safi Organics has developed a process that allows fertilizer to be produced on a village-level basis, using locally available agricultural by-products and labour. Their technology reduces the logistical cost and produces a high-quality product that sequesters large amounts of carbon and can improve farmers’ yields by up to 30%.\n\nRead more about the Ellen MacArthur Foundation Food initiative: https://www.ellenmacarthurfoundation.org/our-work/activities/food\nInside the Circular Economy in Africa: https://www.ellenmacarthurfoundation.org/our-work/activities/learning-opportunities/focus-on-africa\nAbout Safi Organics: https://safiorganics.co.ke/\n\nFunded by the IKEA Foundation.\n------\nThank you for watching this video.

Currently, cities are grappling with the effects of our current take-make-waste, linear economy. They consume over 75% of natural resources, produce over 50% of global waste, and emit 60-80% of global greenhouse gases. At the same time, cities continue to grow; by 2050, two-thirds of us will live in cities. They are engines of economic growth and centres of culture, innovation, and learning. As city governments look to recover from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and address major challenges like the climate crisis, the circular economy offers a systems solutions framework that can unlock economic, environmental, and society-wide benefits.\r\nCity governments can enable, lead, and involve other key stakeholders from across the public and private sectors, using the wide range of policy levers and measures at their disposal. In this episode, we will hear from the Ellen MacArthur Foundation’s three Strategic Partner Cities— London, New York City, and São Paulo—about advancing the circular economy and mobilising systems solutions.",

To circulate packaging, we need dedicated, ongoing, and sufficient funding for collection, sorting, and recycling – otherwise the economics simply do not stack up – it costs more to do, than the money it makes. \r\n\r\nThe only proven way to provide the necessary funding is through schemes where the companies putting packaging on the market are required to pay for its collection, sorting, and recycling — such schemes are called extended producer responsibility (EPR). \r\n\r\nEPR can be more than a financing tool for recycling. It’s an opportunity to improve transparency, incentivise better packaging design and reduce carbon emissions.",

But there is still much to do — we need pioneers to demonstrate what is possible, and most of the innovation we need to scale the circular economy transition has not yet been established.\n\nThese are the highlights from the episode that was streamed live on our channels on 2nd March. We heard from Lay Koon Tan, co-founder of Nature Squared, and Katie Treggiden, author of Wasted: When Trash Becomes Treasure. In this discussion, we explored the opportunities and challenges in circular design and their personal experiences and insights , emphasising the role design plays in the transition to a circular economy. \n\nWatch the full episode here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTgK7dHiqUk&t=1898s\n\nFind out more about Circular Design here: https://www.circulardesignguide.com/\n\nMore episodes of The Circular Economy Show here: https://www.ellenmacarthurfoundation.org/our-work/activities/the-circular-economy-show\n\nMore about our work here: https://www.ellenmacarthurfoundation.org/\n\nEpisode 25 - Highlights\nStreamed on: 2.3.21\n\n#circulareconomy",

The result? Everyone stands to gain. Healthy, fresh food becomes available at local markets and at restaurants that strive to make the most of food. Family farmers working on the peri-urban areas of the city enjoy access to opportunities, which improves their quality of life. And the soil that grows our food can receive back the nutrients from inedible by-products and bio-waste, which are processed at local composting facilities.",

Join us in this episode as Stephanie Kelton discusses the role of Modern Monetary Theory in shifting common misconceptions around government deficits. We tend to associate deficits with negative connotations such as rising taxes and destabilisers of the economy. However, is this the result of the deficit itself or rather the decision making of governments? Is it possible to shift our use of government deficits towards boosting job creation, driving innovation, and propelling us towards an economy of regeneration and restoration; a circular economy?\n------\nThank you for watching this video.

Breaking the Plastic Wave confirms that the circular economy vision is the only way to address plastic waste and pollution at the source, while also resulting in better economic, climate, and social outcomes. It shows that to realise this vision, we need to collectively raise our ambition level, and stresses the need to act now, as an implementation delay of five years will result in an additional 80 million tonnes of plastic entering our oceans between now and 2040.\n\nPlease join our speakers to learn more about Breaking the Plastic Wave and how a circular economy offers a solution to address plastic pollution at source.\n------\nThank you for watching this video.

This is particularly the case in London, home to many leading colleges and universities, reaching over half a million students and staff annually. Universities are hubs, bringing together local councils, schools, businesses, and the wider community. This gives them the ability to act as a convening force to share knowledge and raise awareness. Working with the London Waste and Recycling Board and 40+ universities, our bespoke HE-led city demonstrator project in London aims to harness the collective power to demonstrate how the education sector can support the city’s circular economy ambitions. During this live session, we will be speaking to Imperial College, University College London, London School of Economics, London Interdisciplinary School and the London Waste and Recycling Board  about their circular economy activities and ambitions as part of this collective approach in London.\n------\nThank you for watching this video.

Natural systems are inherently regenerative. \r\nBut what might this look like in reality? What will be the role of technology and urban-rural relationships in achieving these visions? We hear from three experts and practitioners who will share their visions for a regenerative food system. \r\nReturning nutrients to the land: Imagine a future where we start to realise the value in things that are either being thrown away or are not sufficiently valorised today - the implications of this are huge. In a food system context, discarded organic materials would no longer be a public nuisance, an expense or a health or environmental hazard, but instead their inherent value would be recognised, and the things that are wasted today could become inputs to a thriving economy for food. After preventing edible food waste and designing new food products, by-products would become valuable inputs to the wider economy - and nutrients would be returned safely to the land, the topic of this session.\n\n------\nThank you for watching this video.

And will this then have a direct implication on how it is realised on the ground?\n \nChallenges of implementing a circular economy are a frequent discussion point amongst businesses, policy makers and other organisations as they grapple with the reality of how to actually ‘do it’. Just how do you make even the tiniest step towards enabling a seismic shift to a totally different economic system? What barriers need to be overcome?\n \nThese ever-growing conversations, articles and reports often point to the obvious challenges posed by things like existing finance mechanisms, government strategy and policy, reverse supply chains and infrastructure, or customer behaviour patterns. Whilst these are all important of course, there is a challenge that is not often mentioned, yet lurks within many of these conversations – words and terminology.\n \nThe group will look at why deciding on the words and terms that you use to describe the circular economy might be as important to the transition as finding alternatives to single use plastic. In a light-hearted, conversational setting the group will touch on words, phrases and terms that they have found, over the last 10 years, to be either friend or foe.\n\n------\n\nThank you for watching this video.

In this live conversation, members of the Ellen MacArthur Foundation team will discuss and debate some of the underlying values and topics relevant to the circular economy.\n\nFor example, how much does the circular economy differentiate from sustainability or the notion of recycling on steroids? Is it more about efficiency or effectiveness, and does that even matter? Is it better implemented as a top-down or bottom-up approach?\n\nThis broadcast features four members of the Ellen MacArthur Foundation team:\n\nSeb Egerton-Read, Learning Programmes Lead - has been working with the Foundation for six years. Currently leads our institutional learning programmes including Learning Hub and the From Linear to Circular programme.\n\nStella Chavin, Business Activation Manager - works with our network partners on activating collaborative projects and delivering inspiring workshops.\n\nSarah O'Carroll, Government & Cities Network Manager -  facilitates networking and knowledge sharing between the Foundation’s government and cities members; working with them to build collaborations with each other and other parts of the network.\n\nLaura Franco Henao, Learning Engagement Manager - working within the Foundation and external partners to create valuable and inspiring content through regular live broadcasts (such as this one) to build an understanding of the circular economy.\n------\nThank you for watching this video.

Biodiversity.\nHuman health.\nWhat’s the connection? \n\nFood.\n\nChanging our food system is the most impactful thing we can do to address climate change, create healthy cities and rebuild biodiversity\n\nYou’ve probably been thinking about how you and your organisation can play your part\n\nMaybe you’ve created your own targets and manifestos, are supporting the Sustainable Development Goals, or Paris climate agreement.\n\nBut that’s the easy part. The real challenge is knowing where you can have the biggest impact\n\nThe answer lies in cities - that’s where 80% of food will be consumed by 2050. \n\nBy using circular economy thinking, cities, and the businesses and people in them have the power to transform the food system \n\nBut what would that look like?\n\nFood would be grown in ways that support ecosystems instead of damaging them. And it would be sourced locally, when it makes sense. \nWe would make the most of food, avoiding edible food waste \n\nand using organic by-products to improve soil fertility to grow new ingredients, along with other uses\n\nAt the outset, chefs and food brands would consider these principles when they’re planning what goes on our plate\n\nIt sounds simple - but it’s one of the most ambitious and profound challenges of our time\n\nIf we get it right, we’ll help avoid a climate crisis, restore biodiversity, improve human health and reconnect people with their food - all the while creating new business opportunities.\n \nThe Ellen MacArthur Foundation’s Food initiative brings together pioneering restaurants, supermarkets, food brands, and governments to ignite a transition towards a regenerative food system \nReach your ambition.

In a city like New York alone, 200 million pounds of clothing are being landfilled annually - that is the equivalent of over 440 Statues of Liberty. Globally, 73% of the materials used to produce clothing are landfilled or burned at the end of their life, while less than 1% of old clothing goes on to be used to make new clothes.\n\nTwo recent campaigns - Wear Next (New York) and Love Not Landfill (London) - aimed to divert clothes from landfill and encouraged brands and citizens to embrace the new mindset and make our wardrobes really work. They say that whether it’s swapping them, selling them, donating or recycling them, it’s possible to work together to prevent clothing from ever becoming waste.

According to the UN, plastic packaging accounts for nearly half of all plastic waste globally, and much of it is thrown away within just a few minutes of its first use. Much plastic may be single-use, but that does not mean it is easily disposable. When discarded in landfills or in the environment, plastic can take up to a thousand years to decompose. Alarmingly, plastics are now entering our food systems. By 2050, there will be more plastic than fish in the world’s oceans.\n\nEcoware was founded to confront the plastic problem head-on. They make and sell 100% biodegradable and compostable packaging that negates the need for single-use plastics. Made from the waste of common agricultural crops, Ecoware has disposable tableware, packaging and medical-care products that offer an affordable and sustainable alternative.\n\nHow did they do it?

        "description": "A shift towards fast fashion in the past two decades has led to a dramatic decrease of the practical service life of clothes (how long they are worn) compared to their technical service life (how long they could be worn). Today, consumers buy 60% more and keep their clothes for half as long and a shocking ±70% of closets go unworn. Extending the active service life of garments is considered one of the most effective ways to reduce the overall impact of the clothing industry; by decreasing the need for production of new garments and reducing the growing volumes of textile waste that is generated every year.\n\n“Switching Gear: Towards a Circular Business Model”, is a C&A Foundation supporte project, led by Circle Economy, that supports 4 apparel brands in the design and launch of rental and recommerce business model pilots by 2021.\n\nIn this session, we will be joined by three innovators from the Switching Gear Enabling Network (SGEN), including The Renewal Workshop and Stuffstr, who are already pioneering these alternative business models. SGEN is a global network of +50 circular solution providers, frontrunning brands and relevant experts, built in collaboration with Fashion for Good. Join us to explore how new circular business models are disrupting the norm and learn about the latest innovations in rental and recommerce and the opportunities and challenges that these new models present.\n\n------\nThank you for watching this video.

All across the developing world, formal waste management social enterprises have popped up to provide ethical and efficient solutions to our plastic epidemic, yet they are often underfunded and left unable to scale.\n\nInspired by carbon credit, plastic offset is a transformative way of funding these innovations to accelerate our transition towards a circular economy. Just like carbon, there are as many ways to do plastic offset wrong as ways to do it right. With the complex relationship between consumer responsibility and producer accountability, generating truly meaningful impact is challenging yet entirely possible.\n\nHow do you make it happen? Is a plastic credit system part of the solution? From the landfills and alleyways of Mumbai to corporate headquarters in New York, we will explore both local needs and the global systems that govern our waste.",

        "description": "Less than 1% of the material used to produce clothing is recycling into new clothing, meaning that one truck's worth of clothes is disposed of in landfill every second. However, some designers, manufacturers and brands are beginning to behave differently, rethinking the dominant take-make-waste linear model.\n\nOne example of that is the story of Rapanui, where they've embarked on a journey that considers the entirety of the products that they make and everything that sits around it. Making clothing from natural materials, using renewable energy, and designing it in a way that ensures it can be sent back when it is worn out. They make new products from the materials that they recover. Producing t-shirts in real time, seconds after they were ordered, to make sure that they only make what people actually need, when they need it. And then building a free platform that allows anyone in the world to access their supply chain and technology.\n\nIt all started in a shed in a back garden on the Isle of Wight, where two brothers set out with the bold ambition to redesign the fashion industry. Join this session to hear the story so far.\n\n------\nThank you for watching this video.

But whether circular jobs are inherently better than jobs in linear sectors remains to be seen.\n\nAs the resource management sector continues to grow in the circular economy, how can we ensure that the jobs this creates are high quality jobs, rather than dirty work?\n\nIn the face of new business models and technological advancement, how can the circular economy create jobs for both high and low skilled workers?\n\nThe transition to the circular economy constitutes a systemic shift across sectors, geographies and demographics. What role should public and private actors play in ensuring the circular labour market is an inclusive one?\n\nCircle Economy is working to secure a positive transition to circularity for work and workers. In this session, Circle Economy will moderate a discussion between three experts and the DIF audience to explore these questions and more.",

        "description": "Waste and pollution are not accidents, but the consequences of decisions made at the design stage. By chaining our mindset to view waste as a design flaw, we can ensure waste and pollution are not created in the first place.\n\nPetroleum is at the heart of most our systems and is the basis of our linear economy. It is impossible to evolve a circular system on a source that cannot be renewed. What are the alternatives? Organic material (plants) - the origin of petroleum - is a sound option. It is naturally abundant, ubiquitous and already produced in large quantities by agriculture.\n\nSo why isn’t this material used today?\n\nPlants are designed to cope with environmental stress (parasites, weather) and only minor parts can be deconstructed easily. These part are usually edible. The majority is very difficult to upgrade in a way that leads to ‘petroleum-like’ molecules. However, researchers at EPFL in Switzerland have developed a way in which plants can finally be fully valorised and utilised as petroleum.",

This massive inefficiency in how consumer products are designed, manufactured and sold is why billions of pounds of wasted plastic pollute the land, sea and air every year. Something had to be done. This was the inspiration that created Replenish, a reusable bottle and concentrate refill platform that makes it easy for consumers to add their own water, at the point of use instead of at a far away factory, to make the products they use every day. Replenish aims to break the endless cycle of waste in today’s fast moving consumer goods industry.\n--\nThank you for watching this video.

        "description": "Jeannette loves setting up circular systems that save resources in our everyday lives, and that makes it easy to integrate environmentally positive individual behaviours without thinking too much about it. She has been researching reusable packaging solutions in the food and beverage industry for almost 10 years. Her aim: To banish disposable packaging from our lives. In 2014, she tested the feasibility of a public Takeaway reusable circulation system. After a successful test phase, she launched the reCIRCLE network in 2016, with almost 1’000 partner restaurants to date. reCIRCLE now replaces around 50’000 disposable containers per day. Jeannette comes from the hotel and tourism industry, took further training in marketing and event management and completed her master's degree in environmental technology and -management in 2015. She is convinced that reusable systems could be implemented in many other industries, such as shipping or cosmetics or many more.

        "description": "Ellen MacArthur and Stella McCartney co-launched the Ellen MacArthur Foundation’s latest report A new textiles economy: Redesigning fashion's future on November 28, 2017. The report, created by the Circular Fibres Initiative which launched in May this year, calls for the fashion industry to adopt this new vision and create cross industry collaborations to achieve it.\n\nClothes are an everyday necessity, and for many an important expression of individuality. Yet the industry’s current take-make-dispose model is the root cause of many environmental impacts and substantial economic value loss. Every second, the equivalent of one garbage truck of textiles is landfilled or burned. An estimated USD 500 billion value is lost every year due to clothing that’s barely worn and rarely recycled. If nothing changes, by 2050 the fashion industry will use up a quarter of the world’s carbon budget. As well as being wasteful, the industry is polluting: clothes release half a million tonnes of microfibres into the ocean every year, equivalent to more than 50 billion plastic bottles. Microfibres are likely impossible to clean up and can enter food chains.\n------\nThank you for watching this video.

From 1992 to 1998 she was the scientific and project director of an EU funded project for bionutrient recycling in Brazil and China. The pilot projects demonstrated safe and highly productive re-use of nutrients from effluent, generating clean water as a byproduct. \r\n\r\nKatja Hansen was a founding contributor to the Brazilian NGO \"O Instituto Ambiental\" which took over the technology and built facilities across Central and South America. Some facilities were built in Haiti where they survived a devastating earthquake and continued purifying water and recycling nutrients when other sanitation systems failed. The technology is now supported by UNEP in Haiti.\r\n\r\nThis film was recorded by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation and University of Bradford, at Cisco Studios London, October 2011.\n------\nThank you for watching this video.

Vet is a professor of Evolutionary Ecology at Wageningen University and director of the Netherlands Institute of Ecology (NIOO), the largest institute of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences (KNAW). She is a biologist with a broad interest in ecology and evolution of multitrophic interactions. Her research involves chemical, behavioural and molecular ecology of plants and insects in a community context, delivering basic knowledge for the strategic development of sustainable agro-ecosystems that are primarily based on the prevention of pests and diseases (life-support function of biodiversity). She is an elected member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences. Vet was awarded several international prizes for her research (e.g. British Rank Prize for Nutrition) and serves on a diversity of national and international boards and committees. In addition to her professional interest in high quality ecological scientific research she has a special interest in communicating the importance of ecology to the general public (lectures, columns, media). Her recent outreach focuses on achieving a positive interaction between ecology and economy. Practice what you preach: she was the driving force behind the realization of the highly innovative and sustainable laboratory/office complex of the NIOO (nieuwbouwnioo.nl). Linked to these building activities Vet stimulates public-private partnerships to encourage new eco-technological developments.\n------\nThank you for watching this video.
